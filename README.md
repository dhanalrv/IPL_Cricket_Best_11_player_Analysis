**Data Analysis Steps** :
1. Used Python for data cleaning and Transformation of the json data files to csv files which makes futher Analysis easier.
2. Used MS Excel for further glance on data cleaning and Transforming.
3. Used PowerBI for further transformation and Visualization of insights driven through the Analysis.

**DataCleaning and basic Transformations Using Python (Jupyter Notebook)** : 
1. Read the Json files into pandas dataframe and performed Data Cleaning and checked the data types.
2. Handled the Null and duplicate data.
3. Renaming of column names and cleaned up the weired charaters.
4. Added new columns which helps in joining the tables and maintain the relationship between tables.
5. Data Transformations are performed to make data more efficient to draw insights.
6. Finally write the cleaned and transformed data to csv files.
    dim_match_summary.csv
    dim_players_no_images.csv
    fact_bating_summary.csv
    fact_bowling_summary.csv

**DataCleaning and Transformations Using MS Excel** :
1. Open the files in excel and re-verified the data, make sured the data was cleaned and in required format.
2. Added the new column image manually which can help in visualization.
   	--> dim_players.csv

**Data Visualization using PowerBI** :
1. Loaded the data into powerBI and Transformed the data through power Query.
2. Verified the data was cleaned and was in required format.
3. Verified the data model and relationship between the tables.
4. Created the Statistical measures which help in dashboard calculations. Below are the measured & calculated columns used-
